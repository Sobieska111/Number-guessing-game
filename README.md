A simple number guessing game built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
The app randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has 10 attempts to guess it. After each guess, the game provides feedback whether the correct number is higher or lower.

This is a basic Android project for practicing Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.
